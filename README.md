Hey there! I'm Hardik Jain, a college student diving into the world of web development and freelancing. I'm also the creator behind the Dhonidev AI channel, where I explore building AI-powered web experiences. This portfolio website, which you're looking at the code for, is built with React and Three.js, using the tech stack shown. It was inspired by a tutorial from JavaScript Mastery on YouTube.
